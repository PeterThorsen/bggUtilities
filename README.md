An advanced program for displaying and 
interpreting boardgames and the users plays 
of them.

The program allows the user to see who they 
have played with and ask for recommendations 
on which games to play, which will be 
calculated depending on numerous factors to 
select a fitting game for the users complexity 
range, time limit and co-players.

To login, input your BoardGameGeek username. The program was developed with my own user in mind (cwaq). You are welcome to try the program with this login.

Have fun! Try double clicking on a players name.
